Understanding Git is crucial for modern development. Here's a guide to the essential commands and workflows.

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Initialize a repository
git init

# Add files to staging
git add .

# Commit changes
git commit -m "Your message"

# Push to remote
git push origin main
```

## Branching Strategy

A typical workflow includes:

1. Main/Master branch
2. Development branch
3. Feature branches
4. Hotfix branches

## Best Practices

- Write clear commit messages
- Commit often, push regularly
- Keep branches focused
- Review before merging

## Common Scenarios

### Fixing a Bad Commit

```bash
# Undo last commit
git reset --soft HEAD~1

# Amend commit message
git commit --amend
```

Remember: Git is your friend, not your enemy. Take time to learn it properly!
