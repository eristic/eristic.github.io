Docker has become an essential tool in modern development. Let's learn the basics of containerization.

## What is Docker?

Docker allows you to package applications with all their dependencies into standardized units called containers.

## Basic Commands

```bash
# Pull an image
docker pull node:latest

# Run a container
docker run -d -p 3000:3000 my-app

# List containers
docker ps

# Stop a container
docker stop container_id
```

## Dockerfile Example

```dockerfile
FROM node:18
WORKDIR /app
COPY package*.json ./
RUN npm install
COPY . .
EXPOSE 3000
CMD ["npm", "start"]
```

## Docker Compose

```yaml
version: '3'
services:
  web:
    build: .
    ports:
      - "3000:3000"
  db:
    image: postgres
    environment:
      POSTGRES_PASSWORD: example
```

## Best Practices

1. Use official base images
2. Minimize layer count
3. Multi-stage builds for production
4. Don't run as root

Remember: Containers should be ephemeral and stateless!
