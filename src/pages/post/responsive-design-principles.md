Responsive design is more important than ever with the variety of devices accessing the web. Here's how to do it right.

## Mobile-First Approach

Start with mobile layouts and progressively enhance for larger screens:

```css
/* Mobile base styles */
.container {
  padding: 1rem;
}

/* Tablet and up */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
  .container {
    padding: 2rem;
    max-width: 720px;
    margin: 0 auto;
  }
}
```

## Flexible Grids

Use relative units and flexible grids:

```css
.grid {
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: repeat(auto-fit, minmax(250px, 1fr));
  gap: 1rem;
}
```

## Responsive Images

```css
img {
  max-width: 100%;
  height: auto;
}
```

## Breakpoint Best Practices

Common breakpoints:

- Mobile: 320px - 480px
- Tablet: 768px - 1024px
- Desktop: 1024px and up

Remember: Design for content, not devices!
