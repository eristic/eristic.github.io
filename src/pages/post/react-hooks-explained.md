React Hooks have transformed how we write React components. Let's break down the most important hooks and their use cases.

## useState: Managing State

The most basic hook for managing component state:

```jsx
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
const [user, setUser] = useState(null);
```

## useEffect: Side Effects

Handle side effects in your components:

```jsx
useEffect(() => {
  document.title = `Count: ${count}`;
}, [count]);
```

## Custom Hooks

Create reusable logic with custom hooks:

```jsx
function useWindowSize() {
  const [size, setSize] = useState({
    width: window.innerWidth,
    height: window.innerHeight
  });
  
  // ... implementation
  
  return size;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Keep hooks at the top level
2. Name custom hooks with 'use' prefix
3. Keep effects focused and minimal
4. Use dependency arrays correctly

Remember: Hooks are a powerful way to reuse stateful logic without class components.
