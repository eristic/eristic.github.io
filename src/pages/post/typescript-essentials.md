TypeScript has become an essential tool in modern web development. Let's explore why and how to use it effectively.

## Why TypeScript?

TypeScript offers several advantages over plain JavaScript:

- Static typing
- Better IDE support
- Early error detection
- Enhanced code maintainability

## Key Concepts

### Type Annotations

```typescript
let name: string = "John";
let age: number = 30;
let isActive: boolean = true;
```

### Interfaces

```typescript
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}
```

## Best Practices

1. Start with strict mode enabled
2. Use interfaces over type aliases when possible
3. Leverage type inference
4. Keep types simple and focused

## Integration with Popular Frameworks

TypeScript works seamlessly with:

- React
- Vue
- Angular
- Node.js
- Astro
