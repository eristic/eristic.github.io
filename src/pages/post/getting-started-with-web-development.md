Web development can seem overwhelming at first, but with the right approach, anyone can learn it. Here's a structured path to get you started.

## The Foundation: HTML, CSS, and JavaScript

Every web developer should start with these three core technologies:

1. **HTML** - The structure of your content
2. **CSS** - The presentation and styling
3. **JavaScript** - The interactivity and behavior

## Modern Development Tools

Some essential tools you'll need:

- A good code editor (VS Code, Sublime Text)
- Version control with Git
- Browser developer tools
- Package manager (npm or yarn)

## Next Steps

After mastering the basics, you can explore:

- Frontend frameworks (React, Vue, Svelte)
- Backend development (Node.js, Python)
- Database management
- DevOps and deployment

Remember, the key is to practice regularly and build projects that interest you. Start small and gradually increase complexity as you learn.
