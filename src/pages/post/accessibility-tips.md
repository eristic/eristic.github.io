Web accessibility is not just a nice-to-have featureâ€”it's a necessity. Here are essential tips to make your websites more accessible.

## Semantic HTML

Use semantic HTML elements to provide meaning and structure:

```html
<header>
<nav>
<main>
<article>
<aside>
<footer>
```

## ARIA Labels

Add ARIA labels when semantic HTML isn't enough:

```html
<button aria-label="Close menu">
  <svg>...</svg>
</button>
```

## Color Contrast

- Ensure sufficient color contrast
- Don't rely on color alone
- Test with color blindness simulators

## Keyboard Navigation

Make sure your site is navigable with:

- Tab key
- Enter key
- Arrow keys
- Escape key

## Images and Media

- Always include alt text
- Provide captions for videos
- Ensure media controls are accessible

Remember: Accessibility benefits everyone, not just users with disabilities.
