Testing is crucial for maintaining reliable applications. Let's explore different testing strategies and best practices.

## Types of Tests

### Unit Tests

```javascript
describe('Calculator', () => {
  test('adds two numbers correctly', () => {
    expect(add(2, 2)).toBe(4);
  });
});
```

### Integration Tests

```javascript
describe('UserAPI', () => {
  it('creates and retrieves a user', async () => {
    const user = await createUser({ name: 'John' });
    const retrieved = await getUser(user.id);
    expect(retrieved).toEqual(user);
  });
});
```

## Test-Driven Development (TDD)

1. Write a failing test
2. Write minimal code to pass
3. Refactor while keeping tests green

## Testing Best Practices

- Keep tests focused and isolated
- Use meaningful descriptions
- Test edge cases
- Maintain test coverage
- Use mocks appropriately

## Popular Testing Tools

- Jest
- Vitest
- Cypress
- Playwright
- React Testing Library

Remember: Tests are an investment in your application's future!
